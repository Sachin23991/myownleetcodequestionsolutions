In this we have to delte we are only  given node and not head so we dont have acess to the head in a single linked list so how we delete that for that i am writing the code
  /**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
    if (node == NULL || node->next == NULL) {
        // cannot delete if it's the last node
    return;
    }
    ListNode* temp = node->next;// we stored the next value
    node->val = temp->val;      // copy value from next
    node->next = temp->next;// we make the next element as now one
    // now we can delte the temp
    delete temp;




    }
};
